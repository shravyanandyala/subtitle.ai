00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400 
I do not want to choose either country or race. I will come to Vasilevsky Island dying, 

2 
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:24.880 
I will not find a dark blue facade in the dark, I would fall on the asphalt in the faded lines. 

3 
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.240 
And the soul tirelessly, rushing into the darkness, will flicker over the bridges in the Tetragrad smoke 

4 
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.360 
And spring mornings.
